# Overview of React Todo Application Code

The code implements a simple Todo application using React. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking them as completed. The application also uses local storage to persist tasks between sessions.

## Key Components

### 1. State Management
- **`todo`**: A string representing the current task input by the user.
- **`todos`**: An array of todo items, each containing a task, a unique ID (generated using `uuid`), and a completion status (`isCompleted`).
- **`Showfinished`**: A boolean that determines whether to display completed tasks.

### 2. Handlers
- **`handleadd`**: Adds a new todo item to the `todos` state and clears the input field.
- **`handleedit`**: Prepares the application to edit an existing task by setting its value in the input field and removing it from the list.
- **`handledelete`**: Removes a todo item from the list based on its unique ID.
- **`handlechange`**: Updates the `todo` state with the current input value.
- **`handlefinsh`**: Toggles the visibility of finished tasks.
- **`handlecheck`**: Updates the completion status of a task when the checkbox is toggled.

### 3. Effect Hooks
- **First `useEffect`**: Saves the `todos` state to local storage whenever it changes.
- **Second `useEffect`**: Loads todos from local storage when the component mounts, allowing persistence of tasks across page reloads.

### 4. Rendered JSX
- A Navbar component for the application layout.
- An input field for adding new tasks and a button to save them.
- A section displaying the list of todos, with options to show/hide completed tasks, and buttons for editing and deleting each task.

This structure enables efficient management of todo items and ensures a user-friendly interface for task management.
